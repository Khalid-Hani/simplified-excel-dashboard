# Excel Dashboard with Data Cleaning and Pivot Tables

## Introduction

This GitHub project aims to showcase an Excel dashboard that includes data cleaning and pivot tables. The dataset used for this project is the "Bike Buyer" dataset, which contains information about bike buyers.

## Dataset Organization

To keep the spreadsheet project organized, the following tabs were created:

1. **Original Dataset**: Contains the raw data as it was provided.
2. **Dashboard**: This tab houses the final interactive dashboard with charts and filters.
3. **Working Sheet**: A working copy of the original dataset used for data cleaning and preparation.
4. **Pivot Table**: The tab where pivot tables are generated for data analysis.

## Data Cleaning

To ensure data quality and consistency, the following data cleaning steps were performed:

1. **Removed Duplicates**: Duplicates in the dataset were removed to maintain data integrity.
2. **Standardized Gender and Marital Status**: Replaced 'M' with 'Married' and 'F' with 'Female' in their respective columns to avoid confusion.
3. **Income Formatting**: Converted the income column to currency format, removing decimals for clarity and uniformity.
4. **Age Categorization**: Created three age classes (Young, Middle Age, Old) using a formula to classify individuals into appropriate groups for better visualization.

## Pivot Tables and Charts

Three pivot tables were generated to gain insights from the cleaned data:

1. **Average Income and Bike Purchase**: Pivot table and chart showing the average income of bike buyers and non-buyers.

2. **Bike Purchase and Commute Distance**: Pivot table and chart depicting the relationship between bike purchase and commute distance.

3. **Bike Purchase and Age Brackets**: Pivot table and chart displaying the correlation between bike purchase and age brackets.

## Interactive Dashboard

The final interactive dashboard includes the following features:

- Various controllers and filters for users to explore the data interactively.
- Additional tools for further analysis based on marital status, region, and education.
- Enhanced graphs and insights for a more comprehensive understanding of the data.
